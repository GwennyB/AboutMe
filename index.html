            <h2>Let's learn about ME!</h2>
            <p>You're undoutedly here because you want to know more about me.</p>
            <p>Or because you already *think* you know all about me, and you want to test your knowledge.</p>
            <p>Whatever your reason, I'd love for us to get to know one another!</p>
            <h3>Shall we start with a recap of the pop quiz I just forced upon you?</h3>
            <p>My name is Gwendolyn Yvonne Zubatch. (Hint: That's where the 'Zu' comes from.)</p>
            <p>I was born in Houston, TX, and my parents only just made it to the hospital before my arrival. I lived in Houston for only a short time before moving elsewhere... thankfully!</p>
            <p>I love learning! In 2008, I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Mechanical Engineering.  I've since availed myself of other <em>continuing education</em> opportunities, and I'll likely do more of that even into retirement.</p>
            <p>I have a daughter, and my fiance has a daughter and a son. I don't differentiate... I claim them all as my babies, even though they're "launched" from the nest. <em>(leSIIIIIGH)</em></p>
            <p>I'm getting married the last week in March 2019 - my last name will become 'Buchthal' (Hint: That's where the 'Bu' comes from.). Since our friends are getting married just 2 weeks before in Waikiki, we're planning to spend some time exploring Hawaii to start our honeymoon before heading off to Fiji. We're bringing <b>only</b> our children - no other guests. I'm stoked!</p>
