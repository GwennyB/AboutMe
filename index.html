                <h2>Ok, so let's learn about me!</h2>
                <p>You're undoutedly here because you want to know more about me.</p>
                <p>Or because you already *think* you know all about me, and you want to test your knowledge.</p>
                <p>Whatever your reason, I'd love for us to get to know one another!</p>

                <h3>Shall we start with a recap of the pop quiz I just forced upon you?</h3>
                <p>My name is Gwendolyn Yvonne Zubatch. (Hint: That's where the 'Zu' comes from.)</p>
                <p>I was born in Houston, TX, and my parents only just made it to the hospital before my arrival. I lived in Houston for only a short time before moving elsewhere... thankfully!</p>
                <p>I love learning! I can't imagine that I'll ever stop.  My continuing education endeavors to date have included:
                <ul>
                    <li>ACC</li>
                    <li>UT</li>
                    <li>French tutor</li>
                    <li>UW</li>
                    <li>Coursera</li>
                    <li>Code Fellows</li>

                </ul>
                <p>I have a daughter, and my fiance has a daughter and a son. I don't differentiate... I claim them all as my babies, even though they're "launched" from the nest. <em>(leSIIIIIGH)</em></p>
                <p>I'm getting married the last week in March 2019 - my last name will become 'Buchthal' (Hint: That's where the 'Bu' comes from.). Since our friends are getting married just 2 weeks before in Waikiki, we're planning to spend some time exploring Hawaii to start our honeymoon before heading off to Fiji. We're bringing <b>only</b> our children - no other guests. I'm stoked!</p>
