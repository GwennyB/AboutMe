                <h3>Shall we start with a recap of the pop quiz I just forced upon you?</h3>
                <p>My name is Gwendolyn Yvonne Zubatch. (Hint: That's where the 'Zu' comes from.)</p>
                <p>I was born in Houston, TX, and my parents only just made it to the hospital before my arrival. I lived in Houston for only a short time before moving elsewhere... thankfully!</p>
                <p>I love learning! I can't imagine that I'll ever stop.  My continuing education endeavors to date have included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Austin Community College - I completed gen ed requirements to prepare for transfer to University.</li>
                    <li>University of Texas at Austin - I earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering.</li>
                    <li>French - I worked with a private tutor to re-learn the language after not using it for nearly 20 years.</li>
                    <li>University of Washington - I earned a Certificate in Engineering Leadership.</li>
                    <li>Coursera - I took self-paced, online classes in hydraulics applications and Python.</li>
                    <li>Code Fellows - I'm now working toward a Certificate in Advanced Software Development in ASP.NET Core.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>I have a daughter, and my fiance has a daughter and a son. I don't differentiate... I claim them all as my babies, even though they're "launched" from the nest. <em>(leSIIIIIGH)</em></p>
                <p>I'm getting married the last week in March 2019 - my last name will become 'Buchthal' (Hint: That's where the 'Bu' comes from.). Since our friends are getting married just 2 weeks before in Waikiki, we're planning to spend some time exploring Hawaii to start our honeymoon before heading off to Fiji. We're bringing <b>only</b> our children - no other guests. I'm stoked!</p>
                <p>How do I have fun?  Well, I've got a hobby of collecting hobbies. Here's how I've kept myself entertained, in chronological order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>arguing</li>
                    <li>autocross</li>
                    <li>skiing</li>
                    <li>snowboarding</li>
